This project take data from SatNogs and show in decrept in a https page. </br>
You need to add the sat on the start of the time of the satellite in space. If not first download all as csv from SatNogs, 
add to the SQL and then continue. </br>
Right now it's work only for satellites that follow our packet headers. </br>
maybe at the end I will add this to the HSL </br>
my project is both this and the satellite. </br>
